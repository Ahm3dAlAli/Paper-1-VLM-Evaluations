
## 🐍 **Python Code To-Do List (VLM Analysis Pipeline)**


* [ ] **Go through reusltsCheck what is needed and what is not and remove redundancy**

### 🔁 Model & Training Pipeline

* [ ] **Integrate LoRA into latest VLM model**

  * Modify model definition to support LoRA layers
  * Ensure compatibility with current training loop
  * Update checkpoint saving/loading if needed

* [ ] **Update model comparison logic**

  * [ ] Replace `RandomForestClassifier` with `MLPClassifier` or custom MLP
  * [ ] Remove old RF-related metrics/plots
  * [ ] Ensure fair evaluation setup (same deep features input for all models)

### 📊 Evaluation & Analysis

* [ ] **Update comparison script: ResNet vs VLM**

  * Add `MLP` for both ResNet and VLM extracted features
  * Document accuracy/F1 for consistent comparison

* [ ] **Check that LoRA-modified VLM still outputs expected embeddings**

  * Add test script or sanity check (cosine similarity, shape, etc.)

### 🧩 Modalities Handling

* [ ] **Clarify and Refactor "Unpaired Modality" Handling**

  * Review purpose: What does this unpaired modality achieve?
  * Improve docstrings & comments
  * If unclear, consider:

    * Adding a TODO explaining the uncertainty
    * Creating a placeholder function with better naming

### 🧹 Cleanup & Maintenance

* [ ] **Remove Random Forest logic completely**

  * Delete unused imports and function calls
  * Clean related config flags and arguments
  * Delete associated saved models (if any)
